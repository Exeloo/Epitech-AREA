# API Introduction

## Installation

To set up the API, you must first set your terminal node version :
```shell
nvm use
```

Then you must install all packages
```shell
yarn
```

You can now set up your project :

```shell
./setup.sh
```

If you just want to run all apps :
```shell
yarn serve
```

Then you can log api to see if everything is ok :
```shell
docker logs -f area-server-1
```
